# Cloning a Jupyter Notebook/ ipynb file:
The process of clining an ipynb file is slightly different due to it's format. In order to download a copy of it  to your local computer:
1. Open the ipynb file in the repository
2. Click on 'Raw'
3. Use Ctrl+S/right click and save-as  to save the file
4. While saving, remove the .txt file extension and change saving type to "All Files" 
5. If you encounter errors in the above step, while saving the file edit the file name and manually enter as FILENAME.ipynb and rename it back to the original name after saving. (Windows sometimes saves it as a text file inspite of removing the .txt extension, hence using a different file name while saving helps, but remember to rename it agian to the original file name after saving :) )
